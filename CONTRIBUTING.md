## How Can I Contribute?
- If you have any suggestions to improve our project, please fork this repository, create a pull request and describe what your contribution or issue is.

## Spin up the dev server
1. Pull the repo down locally
2. Install packages: `npm install && npm run npm:fullInstall`
3. Ensure `./grafana.sh` is executable (`chmod +x ./grafana.sh` if it isn't)
4. `docker-compose up & npm run serve:dev`
5. Default credentials for your dockerized grafana and postgres server:
    - Grafana:
```
    User: admin
    Pass: admin
    Port: 3000
```
    - Postgres:
```
    DB Name: pgdev
    User: admin
    Pass: postgres
    URL: localhost:5432
    Server: localhost:5432
```



## Iteration Roadmap

[] Reimplement data-vis service with home-rolled solution, migrate away from Grafana.
[] Add functionality to connect to more than one database at a time.
[] Add functionality to connect to other types of databases such as MySQL, SQLite.
[] Implement plug-and-play containerization that requires less config.
[] Implement solution that automatically searches for active databases on local machine `nmap -sV localhost -p- | grep ${DB_VENDER}`, or `netstat -an | grep docker` or `ps waux | grep docker`.
[] Integrate Prometheus to allow for time series databases, alerting, and more customization on query and visualization
[WIP] Integrate Open AI as means of suggesting optimized queries, to replace less performant queries
[x] Containerize Grafana, possibly Prometheus, with Docker to enhance overall consistency across environments and operational efficiency
[] Present modal interpretations of performance metrics that succinctly describe the issues and provide actionable recommendations for resolution
